      <!-- Description of bird -->
      <p>
        Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking
        plumage of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks
        ('hackles') and backs ('saddle'), which are typically of brighter,
        bolder colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some
        breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly
        pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The identification
        can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually from the development
        of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the
        male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens
        have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and
        hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called wattles.
        Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and
        throat are called caruncles. Both the adult male and female have wattles
        and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males. A
        'muff' or 'beard' is a mutation found in several chicken breeds which
        causes extra feathering under the chicken's face, giving the appearance
        of a beard.[35] Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance
        flight, although lighter chickens are generally capable of flying for
        short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would
        naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their
        surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.
